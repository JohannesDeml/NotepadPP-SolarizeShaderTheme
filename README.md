## Installation

##### 1.) Set solarized style in Notepad++
This theme only looks good with the solarized style, so first you need to switch to that if your're not using it already.
* Go to _Settings -> Style Configurator..._
* Select _Solarized_ from the select theme dropdown list

##### 2.) Add Theme
* Go to _Language -> Define your Language..._
* Click on _Import_ and select this [xml file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JohannesDeml/NotepadPP-SolarizeShaderTheme/master/NotepadPP_ShaderSolarized.xml)

##### 3.) Open shader file
Whenever you open a shader file the type will be associated with the theme automatically. All open shader files will need to be reopened. Otherwise you can also go to _Language -> CG_Shader_Solarized_ to set the language by hand if you have a extension type I didn't think of.
