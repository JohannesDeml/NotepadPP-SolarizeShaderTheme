## Installation

#### 1.) Set solarized style in Notepad++
This theme only looks good with the solarized style, so first you need to switch to that if your're not using it already.
* Go to Settings -> Style Configurator... S
* Select "Solarized" from the select theme dropdown list

#### 2.) Add Theme
* Go to Language -> Define your Language...
* Click on Export and select the xml file from this repository

#### 3.) Open shader file
Whenever you open a shader file the type will be associated with the theme automatically. All open shader files will need to be reopened. Otherwise you can also go to Language -> CG_Shader_Solarized to set the language by hand if you have a extension type I didn't think of.
